[Verse 1]
Now the party's over
I'm so tired
Then I see you coming
Out of nowhere
Much communication in a motion
Without conversation or a notion

Avalon

[Verse 2]
When the samba takes you
Out of nowhere
And the background's fading
Out of focus
Yes the picture's changing
Every moment
And your destination
You don't know it

Avalon

[Verse 3]
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
When you bossanova
There's no holding
Would you have me dancing
Out of nowhere

Avalon
