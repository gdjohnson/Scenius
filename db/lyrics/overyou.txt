Oh baby this is nowhere.
Wish I was somewhere, over you.
Your sweet lips tell me there's no chance
No more romance, over you.

Oh baby
How can I go on.
Crying so long, over you.
Where strangers look for new love
I'm so lost in love, over you.

Some day
Yes
It might come
Babe

When I'll be babe, over you.
And always up to that moment
I will try to say I'm, over you.

Oh baby
How can I go on?
Crying so long, over you.
Where stranger look for new love
I'm so lost in love, over you.
