[Verse 1]
Blue suns and grey lagoons
Silver starfish with honeymoons
All these and more to choose
If you
Satin teardrops on velvet lights
Morning sickness on Friday nights
Heaven knows what others I might bring
To you

[Verse 2]
Broken partings making strange goodbyes
Hopeless cases with fake alibis
Even hoping we'll be there to share
With you
Blue suns and grey lagoons
Grey lagoons
Grey lagoons
